This landing page is based on the second project of Udacity's "Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program".

This is my hello-world project in implementing JavaScript to make websites dynamic.

The landing page detects the active sections, highlights it; there is a button in the nav to add new sections to the page.

You can visit the page here:
