# Dynamically Adding Content to a Website

This landing page is based on the second project of [Udacity's "Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program"](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011).

This is my hello-world project in implementing JavaScript to make websites dynamic. The landing page detects the active sections and highlights it; there is a button [in the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4) to add new sections to the page; it has a "go to top"-button; it applies smooth scrolling with JS.
