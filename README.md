# Dynamically Adding Content to a Website

This is my hello-world project in implementing JavaScript to make websites dynamic. Here are it's functions:

- It highlights sections which are in the screen
- It adds a navigation item once an element is highlighted
- The navigation is done with JS
- [in the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4) is a button which adds new sections to the page
- There is a "go to top" button
